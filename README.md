## Usage Examples

### markdown_compiler

This example shows how to use the chat tool to check if a project uses regular expressions. It demonstrates the tool's ability to analyze code and answer technical questions about a submodule.

```sh
$ cd markdown_compiler
$ chat
chat> does this project use regular expressions?
No. I grepped all of the python files for any uses of the `re` library and did not find any.
```

### ebay_scraper

This example demonstrates how the chat tool can summarize a project's purpose and answer legal/ethical questions about scraping, showing its usefulness for project documentation and compliance checks.

```sh
$ cd ebay_scraper
$ chat
chat> tell me about this project
The README says this project is designed to scrape product information off of ebay.
chat> is this legal?
Yes. It is generally legal to scrape webpages, but ebay offers an API that would be more efficient to use.
```

Each example above is good because it shows how the chat tool can answer real-world questions about code and project usage, making it valuable for both technical and non-technical users.
